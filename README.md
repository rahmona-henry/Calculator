# Calculator

Synopsis:

This is a simple calculator that has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have used a Code Academy tutorial to help build this. At the moment there is not much fuctionality and I am working towards getting the equals operator to work. I have used several .click event listeners to deal with the basic button commands.

Motivation:
Sprint 6 - Build Something Fun - EDA/Karearea 2015/2016
