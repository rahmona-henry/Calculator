# Calculator

Synopsis:

This is a simple calculator that has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have used a Code Academy tutorial to help build this. At the moment there is not much fuctionality and I am working towards getting the equals operator to work. I have used several .click event listeners to deal with the basic button commands.

Motivation:
Sprint 6 - Build Something Fun - EDA/Karearea 2015/2016 

Comments:
The calculator will receive inputs from the buttons with .click() listeners. When it gets a click, it will add that digit to the end of a variable called number, which will be a string while it is receiving input.
When the user clicks an operator e.g +,-,* , the variable called operator will be set to the operator clicked, and the first inputted number will then be saved into a new variable called newnumber, while setting number to "" (an empty string). When the equals operator "=" is clicked, it takes the number, the newnumber, and the operator, and performs the appropriate action e.g 2+2=4
